## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project performs **celebrity image classification** using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The dataset consists of **5 celebrity classes**, and the task is to correctly classify images into one of these categories.

The notebook follows these main steps:

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**
   - Images are read using OpenCV.
   - Haar cascades are used to detect and crop faces.
   - Images are resized and normalized.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Image samples are visualized.
   - Dataset class distribution is shown.

3. **Model Building**
   - A CNN model is constructed using Keras with layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dropout, Flatten, and Dense.
   - The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss.

4. **Model Training**
   - The model is trained on the preprocessed dataset with validation.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy and loss are plotted.
   - The model is evaluated on test data.
   - Predictions are made and visualized for sample test images.
